> Pretty all over the place list, but these are resources I use all the time!

* [KEXP](https://kexp.org/) - Probably the best radio station all around
* [Libby App](https://libbyapp.com/) - If you don't have a library card get one, you can read tons of books, audiobooks etc from here. Truly awesome!
* [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) - best ad blocker (don't get suckered into using Adblock plus or whatever)
* [ByPass Paywalls Clean](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bypass-paywalls-clean/) - the updated version of ByPass Paywalls, read 4 Bloomberg articles a month instead of three (or constantly deleting cookies)
* [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/news) - one of the few places left where there are good, relatively unmoderated discussions online
* [Adam Tooze substack](https://adamtooze.substack.com/) - Terrific author and incredibly up to date about an insanely wide range of contemporary topics
* [Stephanie Kelton substack](https://stephaniekelton.substack.com/) - Modern Monetary Theory economist, author of **[The Deficit Myth](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45731395-the-deficit-myth)**
* [Claudia Sahm substack](https://stayathomemacro.substack.com/) - economist
* [Heather Cox Richardson substack](https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/) - historian, mostly writes about current American politics
* [Odd Lots podcast](https://www.bloomberg.com/oddlots-podcast) - Macro Econ podcast
* ...more as I think of them!
