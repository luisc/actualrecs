## What Did You Use to Build This Site?

I used the static HTML [site generator Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

## No please list EVERYTHING
Okay fine!
* Text editors: [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) & [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer)
* [Photoshop & Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html)
* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
* [Bulma CSS](https://bulma.io/) - great for handling responsiveness out of the box, mostly
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (for Bulma in jekyll)
* [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) - stock images

## Have you seen [X] dope piece about [Y]?...
Maybe! Probably not though. Shoot me an email, actualrecs ðŸ“§ gmail.

## Can you post my guest blog article about some random product or business?
No.

## Is that your ACTUAL handwriting in the site logo?
Yes! Written with a real world sharpie. Through the magic of the camera on my phone and photoshop, that marker output now appears on your screen.
