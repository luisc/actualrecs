I have been cooking a TON since 2020. The last 6 months I have ratcheted that cooking up a new level, and have also been baking quite a bit.

I love pizza, and I've also been making tons of pies. One thing that is nice about making your own doughs, is that you usually make 3-4 pieces of pizza dough in one batch. You can toss it in the freezer and have a quick meal in no time a week or two weeks from now.

I don't always make the pre-ferment (poolish) that Vito here does, but when I have it is totally worth the time.

If you are queasy about baking or it seems like too much work, it isn't! Well it IS until it isn't. Bread making is quite simple and it requires so few ingredients. Stay tuned, and I will post a ton more about how to get rolling with bread making.

Anyway, this is definitely worth a watch, even if you don't have interest in making your own dough üçï
