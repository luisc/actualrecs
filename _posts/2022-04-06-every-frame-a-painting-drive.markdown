Every Frame a Painting was one of the first in person YouTube recommendations someone gave me, and in some way is probably the actual genesis of this blog.

What I mean by that is, I have had friends send links to YouTube videos since its inception, but I rarely had someone, while hanging out in person, essentially say, "stop everything you are doing, this is awesome, we need to watch it." Well maybe for a cat video or something, but this one was different. When you watch it, you'll know.

If you aren't familiar with Every Frame a Painting, check out the [Wikipedia section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Every_Frame_a_Painting) on it. It was a brilliant supernova of content, and I wish there were more things done just like it. And if you are, well watch this again, as it has probably been a while since you have seen this episode.

Every Frame a Painting is exactly what I want from the internet: genuine human artistry and expertise sharing interesting opinion sthat opens my eyes to new ideas.

I am bound to post more Every Frame a Painting videos as they are some of the best content on Youtube I have ever seen.

For now, let's stick with a review of a movie that I love, [Drive from 2011](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive_(2011_film)) ▶️.

Further reading: I haven't read the [book the movie was based on](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/176378.Drive), but maybe you will!

P.S. Well, I just borrowed it from the library while writing this as I have been meaning to read it for... how long was it that I walked out of that movie theater after seeing Drive? 11 years? Yikes, 2011 was 11 years ago!
