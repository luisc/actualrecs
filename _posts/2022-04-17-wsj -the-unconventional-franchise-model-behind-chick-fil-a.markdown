It's been years since I've had [Chick-fil-A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chick-fil-A). It used to be a really weird hard to get treat for me growing up. Chick-fil-A was only in the mall where I grew up, and we didn't often go to the mall. (Ditto for [Orange Julius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Julius) - which until I found the link for that, I had no idea was still around, let alone [owned by Dairy Queen](https://orangejulius.com/en-us/about-us/).)

I visited Orlando in the early 00s and my mind was completely blown. Wait, there is a CHICK-FIL-A restaurant not in a mall? It's a whole restaurant, just on a regular street?! You can sit down and not be in a weird food court? I am going to eat this every day!

Eventually, I lived in a town with multiple Chick-fil-a restaurants. While I didn't eat it every day, I definitely had my share of waffle fries and a couple pickle slices on a chicken sandwich often enough.

I always wondered how the business worked. It seemed like a franchise, just like a McDonald's, Burger King, etc. but also a little different. Turns out they have a Chick-fil-a manager school. Who knew? üê•

P.S. I'm sort of craving Chick-fil-a now, but it's a Sunday as I write this, so no dice.
