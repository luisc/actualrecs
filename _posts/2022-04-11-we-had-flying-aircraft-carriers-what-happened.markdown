I ran a [tabletop role-playing game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game) in 2021 and set on a zeppelin style airship. The game was [Agatha Christie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agatha_Christie)-ish [Murder on the Orient Express](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/853510.Murder_on_the_Orient_Express) inspired game. I was trying to get the players to think that ANYONE on the airship could have done it (excluding the players themselves obviously - this isn't an [unlucky draw in Clue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluedo) where you are the killer, you don't know it and you land up accusing yourself), and I loved the inescapability of being on an airship. The one trick to running a murder mystery game is that the players aren't Hercule Poirot or Sherlock Holmes... but.

Well, anyway, I digress about the game.

As for airships, other than the Hindenburg crashing, I didn't really know a ton about Zeppelins. I fired up the ol' internet to look up the history of Zeppelins and found some cool stuff while doing my pregame prep. ▶️
