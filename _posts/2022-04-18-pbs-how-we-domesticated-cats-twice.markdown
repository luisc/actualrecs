First off, hold on. Did we humans domesticate cats or did they domesticate us? Most cat "owners" are catering to ever whim of our feline friends: feeding them, regularly picking up their poop. Who trained who? I'm in the camp that cats domesticated us.

Well, PBS skipped over *that part* of domestication and went right to the conventional part pointing out where domesticated cats through [the commensal pathway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication_of_animals#Commensal_pathway). Never heard that term before? Well neither had I!

The cats in the wild crazily look just like a regularly house cat. Check them out! ğŸ˜¼

P.S. I don't often read YouTube comments, but this one made it worth reading!
