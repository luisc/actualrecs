A fond memory that I have as a little kid was trying to make my own lightsaber. It wasn't particularly sophisticated; it consisted of me finding some red tissue paper and putting it over my grandfather's flashlight. (For some reason he always kept [this flashlight](https://i.imgur.com/377sxiD.jpg) next to his bed on the nightstand.)

To my six year old brain, even the ridged silver made it seem more lightsaber like.

Anyway, I turned the flashlight on and was disappointed to see that it worked just... like a flashlight. Maybe if I turned off all the lights off? Nope, just vague circle of light on the ceiling.

Well that's where my experimentation with building light sabers ended. Not with these dudes!
