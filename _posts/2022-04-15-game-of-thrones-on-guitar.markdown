Look, I get it. Everyone hated the ending of [Game of Thrones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones). While I wasn't exactly part of [/r/freefolk](https://www.reddit.com/r/freefolk/), I get the hate. But there were some parts of the last season I liked! I don't remember what they were now, but I know I did at the time ðŸ™ƒ

But we aren't here for hate. We are here for [positivity on the internet](/about/)!

I didn't realize that [D.B. Weiss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._B._Weiss) could play guitar?! And [Scott Ian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_t8sRE2pcxU) on rhythm*! Before you know if you're gonna be [Caught in a Mosh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlLn0UicWrM).

Sign me up! ðŸŽ¸

Further recommended guitar noodling: [Tom Morello soloing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Z1UKYcqNE)

P.S. * I have never once spelled the word **rhythm** correctly on my first try.
