I am a devout listener of [KEXP](https://kexp.org/), a genuinely great listener supported radio station based in Seattle. During one of their [Wo'Pop shows](https://www.kexp.org/shows/WoPop/) probably sometime in probably 2014 I [heard this unbelievable song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyL4c_LDCl0) and immediately [Shazam'd it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shazam_(application)). (There's a decent chance that you have heard that song as it was soon thereafter in an [Apple commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2uSGFgFn2Q).)

After getting the compilation, [Who is William Onyeabor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_is_William_Onyeabor%3F),  put out by [David Byrne's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Byrne) label [Luaka Bop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luaka_Bop), I knew I had to find out more about this guy!

I googled around and found some articles [here](https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2017/01/18/510410574/william-onyeabor-mysterious-funk-musician-dies-at-70) and [there](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jan/18/who-was-william-onyeabor-nigerian-synthesizer-whiz). Eventually I found this documentary posted to YouTube. It's definitely worth a watch! ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
