Using [Bayes' theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_probability) is something that never quite clicked with me back when I was taking math and science classes at the university level. It's probably why I am not a scientist today!

I read [Sean Carroll](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/)'s [The Big Picture](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26150770-the-big-picture) a couple years ago, and his Chapter 9 on Bayes and his theorem made a lot of sense. Then a few weeks ago, I stumbled on this video and voila! For the first time Bayes' theorem *really* clicked with me.

Bayes' theorem is at the heart of modern scientific thought. Instead of being 100% certain that you can know something, Bayesian stats allow you to assign how likely something is to be true, given a number of random samples.

That is if I understood the folks who made this video! ▶️
