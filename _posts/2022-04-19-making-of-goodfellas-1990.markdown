I saw [Goodfellas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodfellas) in the theater when I was a little kid. My mother had a habit of watching completley inappropriate movies for kids with me ([Alien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_(film)), [Jagged Edge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagged_Edge_(film)), and [The Believers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Believers) are the first that come to mind). I think it was mostly because she didn't like watching dumb kid movies.

Anyway, so Goodfellas. While this movie is now clearly a formula movie for Scorsese. Casino, Wolf of Wall Street, The Irishman are all mostly the same thing; at the time it felt completely revolutionary for a mob/crime film.

[Tony Zhao](https://twitter.com/tonyszhou?lang=en) in one of his recent video essays for [Netflix's Voir](https://www.netflix.com/title/80990130) pointed out the uncomfortableness of the Henry when he beats up Karen's neighbor for sexually assaulting her. At first you sympathize with Henry for doing the right thing, caring out revenge for Karen. Then as the scene keeps going on as Henry keeps smashing the assaulter's head in you start feeling, "uhh Henry stop!"

That scene is in stark contrast to [The Godfather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather) where the mob and the violence is largely romanticized. In Goodfellas you get to see the romanticized part too but also the pure decay and fallout from living a life of crime.

This making of is great and worth a watch! ðŸ“½

P.S. I read (listened) to the [book Wiseguy](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/158141) in 2020 that Goodfellas is based on. Highly recommend it. The audiobook was good too with separate narrators doing the voice of Henry and Karen, much like the film.
