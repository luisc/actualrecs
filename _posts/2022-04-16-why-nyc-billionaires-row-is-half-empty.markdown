When I first saw that first odd pencil thickness skyscraper in the Manhattan skyline, I wondered what the heck the building was. I distinctly thinking how odd it looked, and I knew that eventually it would just sorta look normal. Now there are many of those distinctly tall buildings easily seen from across the water.

In 2021, I was reading a guilty pleasure book: [Daylight](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53522588-daylight) an Atlee Pine thriller. (These books are fun, completely ridiculous and I accidentally read the third book before the second, and, uh, I didn't really notice.) One of the key scenes in Daylight takes place in Billionaires' Row, and I put two and two together. I didn't even realize those giant, tiny buildings had a name!

If you haven't seen these buildings they are really weird. Unsurprisingly, there is some sketchy stuff going on with the affordable housing that they are supposed to provide. (All new big developments in NYC have to provide some amount of affordable housing.) ▶️
