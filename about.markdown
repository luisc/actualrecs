> I know that YouTube has great content. But it's hard to find.

If you regularly go to your YouTube homepage, you'll know what I mean. Maybe that first row of recommendations has something good. After that, it's usually a murky realm of mostly things you don't want to watch.

People are still better than computers at some things. One of them is recommendations, especially *novel recommendations*. Something that doesn't otherwise connect but it just works. 

That's where my idea for this blog came. I'm here to give you:  
**Actual Recommendations**

## Philosophy
### Positivity
There's an inordinate amount of negativity on the internet. One click on any heavily replied to tweet makes me question if the whole of humanity has lost its mind.

While I have my own down days like anyone else - I make a conscious effort to only post interesting and thought provoking content here. The subject matter of the content might not be positive (for example, some true crime piece) but the content will be interesting.

### Accessibility
I've done lots of programming and development work, and there is great video content out there for that. I won't be posting any highly technical content on here as I want everything here to be accessible to everyone.

So sit back and relax!

### Sources
Whenever possible, I will try to link to the original creator of a work. Tons of content gets reposted and reused by other folks to get, likes, clicks, subscribers, etc., and I will do my best to give credit to the original creators!

### Advertising
I try to avoid advertising in my own life. I am a big proponent of using [adblockers](https://ublockorigin.com/), and generally do not try to pay attention to advertising. (I am a cord cutter, and when I see regular cable/satellite TV the ads are WILD.)

You know how there wasn't any cookie disclaimer thing on this site? It's not necessary since I am not tracking you, and I am not selling your information to any third party in any way. I don't use google analytics or any other thing tracking your movement on the screen. I figure if you like the content, you will keep reading and watching!

There will never be an affiliate link on this site. You won't ever see one of those weird disclaimers about how I earn a portion of a sale or whatever.

When videos have a paid sponsor, I will try to give you a heads up about it.

## Topics
Many years ago when I was looking for work after finishing college, a short term boss (it was a one or two month database development job) warned me:
> I can tell that you have a lot of interests, and you can do a lot of different things. I've got to warn you though, DON'T become a jack of all trades. Specialize in something.

Well, many moons later and I did not even remotely heed that advice! She was probably right for my career, but I genuinely have interest in ton of different things.

I try to reflect that in this blog while being mindful of not getting too technical in any given subject. Hopefully, some of my interests intersect with yours and you find some great stuff while here!

Enjoy!
